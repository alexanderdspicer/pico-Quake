# general
- [ ] convert all files to space-tabs (might make me a sinner, oh well)
- [ ] Stand alone text editor for editing configs and the like?
# keys.c
- [?] Make Console history work off of pointers, not buffer contents
- [?] DMA when copying Console history
- [ ] 'Key_Event' calls 'Char_Event' when applicable, then remove 'Char_Event' from header
- [ ] eventually add macros for keycode keyboard definitions, such as 'K_TAB'
- [ ] Alter program structure such that 'usb.c' -> 'input.c' <-> 'keys.c' (such that a 'controllers.c' may be defined by prospective individuals)
- [ ] Remove "keydown" in 'key.c' (in favor of direct feeding HID data) and 'console.c' (in favor of key events)
- [ ] send keyboard HID data to 'Key_Event' instead of single keycodes
- [ ] minimize code in 'Key_Console' and move to 'console.c'
# menu.c
- [ ] Make menu modifications to reflect additional abilities, such as pinouts, enabling of I2C stacks/networking etc
# README
- [ ] Write README
# Compilation
- [ ] Design build system, ideally with CMake, although other systems are welcome as well
- [ ] Ensure the following are implemented correctly:
    | "Quake"               |
    |-----------------------|
    | Server infrastructure |
    | Client infrastructure |
    | 3d rendering engine   |
    | palette               |
    | pak loading           |
    | wad loading           |
- [ ] Compile Flags:
    - [ ] 'DEDICATED': indicates whether or not the binary should be built to only act as a server
    - includes compile flags from "pico-OS"
# multicore work
- [ ] Use format set by "pico-OS"
# filesystem
- [ ] Use format set by "pico-OS"
# Networking
- [ ] Use format set by "pico-OS"
