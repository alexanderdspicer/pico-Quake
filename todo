# general
- [ ] convert all files to space-tabs (might make me a sinner, oh well)
- [ ] Stand alone text editor for editing configs and the like?
# keys.c
- [?] Make Console history work off of pointers, not buffer contents
- [x] Refactor Console history out of 'keys.c' and into more appropriate places such as 'cmd.c', or even *remove it all together*
- [?] DMA when copying Console history
- [x] ensure 'menubound' is fully "extinct" and removed
- [ ] 'Key_Event' calls 'Char_Event' when applicable, then remove 'Char_Event' from header
- [ ] eventually add macros for keycode keyboard definitions, such as 'K_TAB'
- [ ] Alter program structure such that 'usb.c' -> 'input.c' <-> 'keys.c' (such that a 'controllers.c' may be defined by prospective individuals)
- [ ] Remove "keydown" in 'key.c' (in favor of direct feeding HID data) and 'console.c' (in favor of key events)
- [ ] send keyboard HID data to 'Key_Event' instead of single keycodes
- [x] remove 'key_dest' and replace with a uint8_t, which is an index to an array of function pointers (callbacks)
- [ ] minimize code in 'Key_Console' and move to 'console.c'
# usb.c
- [ ] Finish implementing USB driver
- [ ] Posture for additional USB support of hubs, ethernet adapters, audio outputs, and mass storage devices
- [ ] Steal extra RAM from USB buffer?
# menu.c
- [ ] Make menu modifications to reflect additional abilities, such as pinouts, enabling of I2C stacks/networking etc
# README
- [ ] Write README
# Compilation
- [ ] Design build system, ideally with CMake, although other systems are welcome as well
- [ ] Build in the following groups:
    | The OS              | "Quake"               |
    |---------------------|-----------------------|
    | usb                 | Server infrastructure |
    | cvars               | Client infrastructure |
    | sound               | 3d rendering engine   |
    | console             | palette               |
    | commands            | pak loading           |
    | filesystem          | wad loading           |
    | networking          | 
    | memory alloc        |
    | 2d rendering engine |
- [ ] Compile Flags:
    - [ ] 'COLOR_MODE': indicates the bit-"ness" of the palette used by the game, i.g. 888, 565, 555 etc.
    - [ ] 'NET_PLAY': indicates whether or not the binary should be built with netplay support
    - [ ] 'SOUND': indicates whether or not the binary should be built with sound support
    - [ ] 'DEDICATED': indicates whether or not the binary should be built to only act as a server
# multicore work
- [ ] Move client, server, and primary rendering to Core 0
- [ ] Move USB handling, Netplay and Sound to Core 1
# filesystem
- [ ] Posture for filesystem & SquashFs Compression (of as of yet determined variety) support
- [ ] Posture additionally for FAT32 file system support for the aforementioned mass storage devices (4gb should be more than enough)
- [ ] When decompressing a SquashFs file, use 4KB blocks such that each block may be loaded into SRAM 4 and/or 5
    so that decompression is less likely to interupt DMA requests. Both 4 & 5 are likely to be used at startup to speed up
    loading the initial RamDisk
- [ ] Level data exclusively in Flash? (~12Mbytes/s) or in USB MSD? (~12Mbits/s)
- [ ] No XIP Cache?
# Networking
- [ ] I2C, USB, Pico W support (Bluetooth, Wifi)
- [ ] Use Alarms for network timeout
